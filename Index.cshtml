                                <p id="modalC">
                                    There are many, many different ways to save money- some of them are really easy, and beneficial to your life!
                                    Work costs you money!
                                    The UK average worker spends £160 on travel to work a month- you can reduce this by walking or cycling if you are lucky enough to live within a reasonable distance of your place of work.
                                    Lunches and snacks from nearby shops can also prove costly- when you are cooking in the evening, why not make a little extra and put it away in a tupperware box for lunch the next day?
                                    Don't forget to claim back your expenses! (Like travelling to work events, taking clients out for lunch etc.)<br />
                                    Buy things second hand! You can get some great, stylish clothes from places like charity shops. You can buy 2nd hand furniture in great condition from places like the British Heart Foundation. 2nd hand cars can save you a fortune!<br />
                                    Look for vouchers online before you make any purchases, or when you're deciding where to eat out for dinner.

                                    When buying a property, you normally take out a <strong id="indpopOut1">

                                            An agreement, usually with a bank, where you pay a monthly amount for a property until you have met the total amount and then own the property!<br />
                                            Usually has a very low interest rate, so you will end up paying more for the house than buying it outright.
                                        </span>
                                    </strong>
                                    You usually need to make a large down payment to the bank, and then find a way of proving that you are trustworthy enough to pay them back (usually achieved using your <strong id="indpopOut2">
                                        credit rating
                                        <span id="indhover2">
                                            A value assigned to you which is basically how likely you are to pay your debts back.<br />
                                            It is mainly based on your ability pay off debts through your life.

                                    </strong>).<br />
                                    This can prove difficult for many people, especially young people who are just beginning to find their way, so many people choose to <strong id="indpopOut3">

                                            Paying a fixed rate to a landlord (who owns the property) in exchange for living there.

                                    </strong> a property from a landlord.
                                    When you are renting, you are flexible to move around as you please. Landlords will make you sign a contract, but it will not be as long term as buying a property.
                                    The landlord is also responsible for paying for anything that isn't up to scratch in the house, like the dishwasher suddenly breaking.<br />
                                    Renting will also boost your credit rating a bit, as long as you create a history of on time rental payments!<br />

                                    Buying is seen as a better long term option however, as you are not paying rent to a landlord. Instead you are paying the mortgage, which will eventually lead to you owning the property and not having to worry about those monthly payments any more!

                                    </strong>, it is very helpful if you can show that you pay off the card every month.
                                    However, owning a credit card and having a negative balance can impact your credit rating in a very bad way, so it is important to manage your credit card carefully.<br />
                                    Credit cards charge a high level of interest, which can lead to a lot of problems if you are unable to pay.

                                    This question is of course totally up to you- you can save as much or as little as you'd like every month!
                                    That being said, it is always nice to have some extra money floating around, so saving at least some money every month is advisable.
                                    It may not seem important right now, but one day you will retire and have to live without earning any money at all!
                                    It depends on how much you earn, of course, but a good suggestion is to try and save 10% of your money each month.<br />
                                    This will allow you to occasionally splash out on holidays and luxury purchases (like a new car), as well as saving some money for when you are old and grey.
                                    Emergency money is always helpful to have as well in case any of your possessions suddenly break!<br />
                                    Getting married and raising a family isn't cheap- if you'd decide you would like to do this, you will likely have to start trying to save a little extra each month and put it aside.<br />
